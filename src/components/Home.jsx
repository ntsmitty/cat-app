// Requirements

//    *  Use React to build your application

//    *  Generate an API authentication token and manage it within the application.

//    *  Build a UI that will display the data digested from the API.

//    *  Should include a view that displays images within a scrollable table view.

//    *  Should allow the user to favorite an image(i.e. jpeg/png, and gifs).

//    *  Should provide a section or area or page that lists the user's favorites.

//    *  Provide a README about this application and how-to-run-it.

 

// Bonus (but not required)

//   *  Navigation for browsing by category.

//   *  Allow for filtering of images by jpeg, png, gif, and category (default to all).

//   *  Provide an alert or notification if/when API is offline.

//   *  Utilize tests when needed (e.g. unit, cases, mocks).

 

// Notes

//   *   Do not worry about design. A simple UI boilerplate or native UI elements will do.

//   *   Completeness is not required, do enough of each requirement to show your understanding of the requirement and your approach.
